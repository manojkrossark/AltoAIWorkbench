## Overview
Alto aims to revolutionize retail operations through intelligent automation and data-driven insights. This project leverages NVIDIA AI Workbench's capabilities to simplify the development of generative AI applications, enhance developer productivity, and optimize workflows in data science, AI, and machine learning.


Our project is designed to revolutionize retail operations through intelligent automation and data-driven insights, leveraging the capabilities of NVIDIA AI Workbench.

1. Predictive Analytics:
Utilizing NVIDIA AI Workbench, we implement real-time demand forecasting and inventory adjustments based on historical sales data. The platform's powerful GPU acceleration enables faster model training and improved prediction accuracy, ensuring that retailers can respond swiftly to changing demand patterns.

2. Customer Experience:
We enhance personalized shopping experiences with tailored recommendations and the ability to schedule deliveries and installations. By integrating Google Generative AI with NVIDIA AI Workbench, we can analyze customer behavior and preferences, delivering insights that create a seamless shopping journey.

3. Geospatial Analytics:
Using location intelligence and the geospatial analytics capabilities provided by NVIDIA AI Workbench, we optimize store placements and resource allocation. This feature leverages GPU power for real-time analysis of location data, helping retailers identify demand hotspots and make informed decisions on new store openings.

4. Inventory Management:
Our solution automates alerts for low-stock items and facilitates cross-store inventory sharing. With NVIDIA AI Workbench, we ensure real-time monitoring and adjustments, maintaining optimal stock levels across locations to prevent shortages or overstocking.

5. Sustainability Insights:
We provide tracking and reporting on the environmental impact of inventory, enabled by the data processing capabilities of NVIDIA AI Workbench. This allows retailers to monitor sustainability metrics and make informed decisions that align with their corporate social responsibility goals.
